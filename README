WHAT IS FILR?

    Filr (pronounced: "Filer") is a django app designed to connect to 
    data streams created by Kral and archive all the data to a unified 
    set of models for interactions elsewhere in your project.

CURRENT FEATURES:

 * Archive All Kral streams, specific ones, or any matching certian critera

 * Concurrently pool data and do batch database writes using kombu/celery

 * M2m relationships to Kral's Query model for easy data access
 

NOTES

	production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
